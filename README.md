# Alert System Gatherer

This project has been created by an EWU senior project team. The purpose of this project is to provide a a single web app that provides information and push notifications for local alerts in the Spokane area. Alerts include WSDOT traffic alerts such as road closures, traffic incidents, road conditions, and severe weather warnings through NWS. The future goal of the project is too include other alert services like fires, crime, and school closures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To get the web app running locally on your system you will first need to get the project files onto your system. Then you will need to install the following components:

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)
* [AngularJS](https://angular.io/)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com/)

These are the four key components of [MEAN stack](http://meanjs.org/)

### Running The Program

1. In your projects directory enter in the command: npm install. This will install all of the node [modules](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp) needed to run this project.
2. Activate MongoDB.
3. In the command line navigate to the CronUpdater folder in your project directory then run the command: node autoUpdater.js. This will fill the database with the current alerts. If you leave it running it will update the data every 5 minutes.
4. In the command line navigate to the projects main folder and run the command: npm start.

You can now access the site locally at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## Project Structure

The project structure is broken up into two parts, the CronUpdater, and the WebApp. 

* The function of the CronUpdater is to check at regular intervals whether or not the WSDOT or NWS has new alerts, update the current alerts, and store this information on the database. The user never see's any part of the CronUpdater.

* The WebApp handles all user interactions like one might see in any other website.

NOTE: While CronUpdater refers to an actual directory in the project structure WebApp is a conceptual term that contains all of the other files and sub directories in the projects main directory.
### CronUpdater

The CronUpdater uses a CronJob at a 5 minute interval to regularly check for new alerts in the Spokane area.

The CronUpdater is made up of the following js files:

* db
* autoUpdater
* emailFunction
* trafficFunction
* weatherFunction
* wsdotSoapFunction

#### db

#### autoUpdater

#### emailFunction

#### trafficFunction

#### weatherFunction

#### wsdotSoapFunction
